          complex (Hey? Regexes are callables? ), maybe it's too
          simple (You have not mixed callables with other kind of data
          structures!), but the whole point of it is that it's there

              <aside class='notes'>This is just an excuse to segue

              <aside class='notes'>Same as writing documentation, you
          have to plan, prepare ingredients, test stuff (documentation
          examples, salt), and then have stuff ready by lunchtime, or
          have it ready to close an issue. So there are
          similarities. But basically, I staid at home to work in the
          grant instead of going to my university office and cooking
          was an excuse to get out, buy fresh groceries, know the
          neighborhood shops, and even renewing the set of tools that
          do the actual cooking. It's been a nice experience, my
          family has enjoyed it, and I have learned a lot. I will
          continue to cook from now on, and stay at home as many days
                as university duties allow. Baseline is stay healthy
          and know the community in your neighborhood. And if you can
          do it in a creative way, much better.</aside>

              you're a geek cook? Cook food and, the most important
              thing, is to clean utensils. And kitchen cupboard
              handles. Pro tip: get everything ready in the table
              before you start, so that you don't have to go get
              something with icky onion-smelling hands from a cupboard.
Cooking stuff has been done very
    extensively in the class tutorial. So I added this to explain how
                to override gists, in the definite and undefinite
